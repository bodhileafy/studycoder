A service account is a special Google account that belongs to your application or a virtual machine (VM) instead of an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.

For example, a Compute Engine VM may run as a service account, and that account can be given permissions to access the resources it needs. This way the service account is the identity of the service, and the service account's permissions control which resources the service can access.

A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account.

Types of Service Accounts
- User-managed service accounts
---PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
-----When you create a new Cloud project using Cloud Console and if Compute Engine API is enabled for your project, a Compute Engine Service account is created for you by default. It is identifiable using the email above
---PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
-----If your project contains an App Engine application, the default App Engine service account is created in your project by default. It is identifiable using the email:
- Google-managed service accounts
----- In addition to the user-managed service accounts, you might see some additional service accounts in your project’s IAM policy or in the Cloud Console. These service accounts are created and owned by Google. These accounts represent different Google services and each account is automatically granted IAM roles to access your Google Cloud project.

- Google APIs service account
--- PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com
----- This service account is designed specifically to run internal Google processes on your behalf and is not listed in the Service Accounts section of Cloud Console. By default, the account is automatically granted the project editor role on the project and is listed in the IAM section of Cloud Console. This service account is deleted only when the project is deleted. Google services rely on the account having access to your project, so you should not remove or change the service account’s role on your project.

When an identity calls a Google Cloud API, Google Cloud Identity and Access Management requires that the identity has the appropriate permissions to use the resource. You can grant permissions by granting roles to a user, a group, or a service account.

Primitive roles, which include the Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles that existed prior to the introduction of Cloud IAM.
Predefined roles, which provide granular access for a specific service and are managed by Google Cloud.
Custom roles, which provide granular access according to a user-specified list of permissions.
